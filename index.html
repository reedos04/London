<h2>London!</h2>
<p>London, the capital of the United Kingdom, was established by the ancient Romans in 47AD. One of the  </br>
oldest and most hisorically rich cities in the world, it's a mecca for a diverse range of individuals, </br>
making it one of the most culturally populated cities in the world: with the majority of worlds nationalities </br>
represented here. There is something for everyone to see and do, from the old heritage listed buildings/ structures </br>
to the famous/infamous inhabitants (The Royal Family to Jack the Ripper ) to the new skyscrapers that </br>
tower over the streets. With easy to use public transport (buses / the tube) and Santander docking bikes</br>
navigating the streets to reach one tourist hotspot to the next makes visiting the city an expierence to </br>
remember. If you are lucky and the weather behaves with blue skies and glorious sunshine you can expect </br>
a many local to be at one Londons spacious parks (Hyde/Regents/Green/Greenwhich/Victoria/London Field) reading </br>
a book or sun bathing while blowing the froth of a pint (drinking a beer) or the cliente of the pubs overflowing</br>
onto the streets you will find the city alive with enthusiastic tourists keen to snap a seflie with Tower Bridge</br>
or the London Eye, every corner here is a story tell. Come to London and write yours!
