	oldest and most hisorically rich cities in the world, it's a mecca for a diverse range of individuals, </br>
	making it one of the most culturally populated cities in the world: with the majority of worlds nationalities </br>
	represented here. There is something for everyone to see and do, from the old heritage listed buildings/ structures </br>

	tower over the streets. With easy to use public transport (buses / the tube) and Santander docking bikes</br>

	a many local to be at one Londons spacious parks</br> (Hyde / Regents / Green / Greenwhich / Victoria / London Field)
	reading a book or sun bathing while blowing the froth of a pint </br>(drinking a beer) or the cliente of the pubs overflowing
	onto the streets you will find the city alive with enthusiastic</br> tourists keen to snap a seflie with Tower Bridge
	or the London Eye, every corner here is a story tell.</br> Come to London and write yours!
